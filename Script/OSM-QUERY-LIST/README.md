# Notes 

You understand IMINT, to map the search, next you know the place to search, for example Jakarta, Indonesia this will help narrow down the search in searching through OSM 

Things to you should take a look:

1. Place object
2. Object of the building
3. Road object
4. Building object
5. Pole objects, lights, signs, railway 
6. Billboard or advertising board object
7. Are there other inventions such as license plates? Place names? Building characteristics
8. Measurement on the object 
9. Extract the information you collected from numbers, houses, trash cans, red lights etc

# Pro Tips
